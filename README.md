# WordPress Plugin Deploy Helper 🤾🏽‍♂️🚀
Helps to easily zip all files and folders to be ready for plugin install

Also for extraction to wordpress-org folder for auto deploy :), don't get?
https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy for more info.

### Note
Make sure you put this file in the same parent directory as your plugin. 
Will think of doing an update for flexible file structure later 💆🏽‍♂️, can't stress 💅
Also try to make your code sniffer ignore this file, e get why ⚠️😁
